//pre increment:  ++i increments the value of i by 1 and uses new value in the statement

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = 1;
        int j = ++i;
        System.out.println("i is "+ i + " j is " + j);
    }
}

o/p:

i is 2 j is 2



//post increment: i++ increments the value of i by 1 and uses original value in the statement

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = 1;
        int j = i++;
        System.out.println("i is "+ i + " j is " + j);
    }
}

o/p:

i is 2 j is 1
