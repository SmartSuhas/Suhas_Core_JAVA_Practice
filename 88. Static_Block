//Static block is a set of instructions that is executed automatically when a class is loaded into memory

//Static blocks will be executed first and if there are multiple static blocks, then they will be executed
in sequential manner as they appear in code and then finally main method will be executed

//Generally used for initializing static members

------

//Test.java

class Test
{
    static
    {
        System.out.println("Inside static block1");
    }
    public static void main (String[] args) 
    {
        System.out.println("Inside main");
    }
    static
    {
        System.out.println("Inside static block2");
    }
}

o/p:
Inside static block1
Inside static block2
Inside main
