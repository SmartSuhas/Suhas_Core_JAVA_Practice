Method Overloading Facts:

1. It's not possible to overload a method just by having different return type
2. main() method can be overloaded
3. String method has higher precedence than StringBuffer method
4. If passed data (say 'char') is differnt than return type of both methods (say 'String' and 'int') then auto promotion takes place
