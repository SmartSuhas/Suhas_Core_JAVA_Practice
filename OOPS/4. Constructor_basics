1. Constructor will have same name as a class
2. They do not have a return type, not even void
3. They are invoked using new operator
4. Executes automatically when we create a object


//Need for constructor:  used for initializing the objects while they are created

Types of constructors:
1. Default constructor
2. User defined constructor with arguments
3. Parameterized constructor

------

1. Default constructor: 
- Compiler generates this by defaut when an object is created (only when user himself doesn't create any other constructor in program)
- Does not contain any parameters

------

2. User defined constructor with arguments:
- User manually creates this constructor
- Does not contain any parameters

------

3. Parameterized constructor:
- User manually creates this constructor
- contains parameters
