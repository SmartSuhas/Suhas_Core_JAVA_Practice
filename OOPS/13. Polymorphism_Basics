//Polymorphism: It is the ability of an object to take on many forms

Types:

1. Compile time polymorphism(Static Polymorphism):
- Achieved through method overloading


2. Run time polymorphism(Dynamic Polymorphism):
- Achieved through method overriding

------

Method overloading:

Conditions:
a. Should have same method name
b. Should be present in same class
c. Arguments must be different i.e different number of arguments or different sequence of arguments or different types of arguments

Method overriding:

Conditions:
a. Should have same method name
b. Should be present in a different class
c. Arguments must be same
d. Should have inheritance
