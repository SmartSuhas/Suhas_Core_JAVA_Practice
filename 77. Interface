//Abstraction using Interface

------

//Test.java

interface I1{

    public abstract void show();  //can also be written as void show();
    
    //public static final a = 10; ------ Equation A
    /* default void display{      ------ Equation B
        
    }  */
    /* static void display{       ------ Equation C
        
    }  */

}

interface I2{
    public abstract void display();
}

class Test implements I1, I2{
    public void show(){
        System.out.println("1");
    }
    public void display(){
        System.out.println("2");
    }
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        Test s = new Test();
        s.show();
        Test d = new Test();
        d.display();
    }
}

Very important points:

a. interfaces should be declared with keyword 'keyword'

b. All the methods defined inside an interface should be abstract method with access specifier as 'public'
i.e public abstract void methodName();  
The same can also be written as  void methodName();
but compiler will assign public abstract to it by default, so both the ways of writing is correct.

c. Equation A represents any field which is declared inside an interface,
it should be of type 'public static final' mandatorily, if not compiler will generate an error

d. Normal methods with body CANNOT be declared inside an interface, it will generate an error
However, on latest versions of JAVA(8 or above), default and static methods as shown in Equation B and C can be created

e.
