Static method: it's used for memory management by reducing no. of objects created,
static method belongs to the class and not to the object

Example 1:

//Test.java

class Test
{
    
    static void display()
    {
        System.out.println("1");
    }
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        
        display();  //it can also be written as Test.display(); as it's in same class writing display(); is also correct
        Xyz.show(); //It cannot be written as show(); as its present in different class, so class name should also be specified as Xyz.show();
    }
}
class Xyz
{
    static void show()
    {
        System.out.println("2");
    }
}
